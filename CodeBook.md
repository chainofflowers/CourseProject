Code Book for "Getting and Cleaning Data" project assignment
=============
This is the code book related to the dataset produced for the Course Project assignment of "Getting and Cleaning Data" course.

The dataset is a text file named "*tidy_dataset.txt*" (not present in this GitHub repository), generated by the R script contained in the file "run_analysis.R". It contains the average values of some measurements in the original raw dataset, as described in detail in the "Variable transformation" section of this document.

## Variables
The dataset is composed of the following variables, in order:
* **activity**: character string, an identifier of the activity. It can assume one of the following values:
  ```
LAYING
SITTING
STANDING
WALKING 
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
```

* **subject**: integer, an identifier of the subject (person) performing the activity. Can assume values from 1 to 30 (inclusive).
* **variable**: character string, the name of the measurement derived from the original dataset, in the form:
   ```
   <domain>-<measurement>-<function>-<axis>
```
  Can assume one of the following 66 values:
  ```
time-BodyAccel-mean-X            
time-BodyAccel-mean-Y            
time-BodyAccel-mean-Z

  ```

* **axis**: character string, identifying the axis to which the measurement refers, if applicable, otherwise "NA". Can assume one of:
  ```
